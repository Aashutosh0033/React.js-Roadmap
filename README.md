## React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces<br><br>

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.<br><br>

Visit the official website for [React.org](https://reactjs.org/) to get more information on React. On this website you'll get an overview on React documentation and related resources. You'll also learn to create your first react app.<br><br>


## What to learn before you learn React<br>
ReactJS is JavaScript-based. You'll need to be familiar with a few things (other than basic JavaScript knowledge) to accelerate your React learning at full speed.<br><br>

**Git Version Control** <br>
Git is a version control tool that helps you manage your source code better. It doesn't have a direct relationship with ReactJS. But it helps if you learn its basic uses so you can take advantage of the development ecosystem.<br><br>

Git is easy to learn when you focus on a few basic things like,<br><br>

* How to initiate a repository
* How to stage/unstage your changes
* How to commit your changes to the repo
* How to push to the remote repository
* How to resolve merge conflicts?<br><br>

Along with Git, you will also need to know how to use a Git-based repository management service like GitHub.<br><br>

**HTML**<br>
HTML provides the structure of a web page. You will use the HTML structure in a new syntax called JSX when you code in ReactJS.<br>
You don't need to know everything about HTML. But you should have a basic knowledge of the most-used tags and semantics. You can check out this [HTML documentation for beginners and this HTML basics guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) to get started.<br><br>


**CSS**<br>
When it comes to CSS, the scope is sky-high. However, focus on the topics mentioned below:<br>
* Basic Selectors<br>
* Pseudo-classes and how to combine<br>
* Box Model<br>
* Flexbox<br>
* Grid<br>
* Positioning(relative, absolute)<br>
* Units(px, em, rem, vh....)<br>

You can learn a lot about CSS on the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)<br>
You can also check out freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) to learn CSS.
<br><br>

**JavaScript**<br>
* You must know the following concepts from JavaScript,<br>
* Variable Declarations (let and const)<br>
* Template Literals<br>
* Functions & Arrow Functions<br>
* Object Destructuring<br>
* Spread and Rest Operators<br>
* Module Import and Export<br>
* A bit of Promises and Async Programming<br>
<br>

**NPM Ecosystem**<br>
You should be aware of how to use npm, yarn, and node version manager (nvm) to help you run and test a ReactJs app locally.<br>
Knowing how they work at a high level is always helpful to debug your environment in case you run into issues. Here is a resource to help you get started with all these quickly: [Node.js install, npm, yarn, nvm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINE4D0Syqw)<br><br>

**How to Deploy, Host, and Make your App Public:**<br>
It won't be much fun if you have created something cool with ReactJS and cannot showcase it to the world. So, you should know how to deploy the app and make it available for public access.<br>
Tools like Vercel or Netlify make it easy to deploy your React app with a few clicks. Here's a tutorial, for example, on [deploying your React app to Netlify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKxvBsGVKR8).<br><br>><br>
