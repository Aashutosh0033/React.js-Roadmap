## React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces<br><br>

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.<br><br>

Visit the official website for [React.org](https://reactjs.org/) to get more information on React. On this website you'll get an overview on React documentation and related resources. You'll also learn to create your first react app.<br><br>


## What to learn before you learn React<br>
ReactJS is JavaScript-based. You'll need to be familiar with a few things (other than basic JavaScript knowledge) to accelerate your React learning at full speed.<br><br>

**Git Version Control** <br>
Git is a version control tool that helps you manage your source code better. It doesn't have a direct relationship with ReactJS. But it helps if you learn its basic uses so you can take advantage of the development ecosystem.<br><br>

Git is easy to learn when you focus on a few basic things like,<br><br>

* How to initiate a repository
* How to stage/unstage your changes
* How to commit your changes to the repo
* How to push to the remote repository
* How to resolve merge conflicts?<br><br>

Along with Git, you will also need to know how to use a Git-based repository management service like GitHub.<br><br>
